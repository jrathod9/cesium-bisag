Done:
Proxy server basic setup
Cesium basic WMS and terrain requests
Creating terain from rasters using ctb-tile
Setup Geoserver, changed default cached settings a bit, if a problem arises with WMS connections, disable "direct integration with WMS of geowebcache"
Made a PostGIS database
PostGIS connection with Geoserver done
QGIS processing scripts done
Connect GWC with postgis done
Creating deleting tables in postgis

ToDo:
Integrate python scripts for QGIS with proxy server
JDBC mosaic tiling for geoserver use of rasters with postgis
Speeding up vector rendering on cesium (can use ol-cesium vector tiling support for that, mostly decreases power for analysis, can keep two modes rendering and processing depending on zoom level)
Automate publishing and deleting to geoserver from postgis
WebCaching is not sure shot, geoserver does not have write permissions for the folder maybe, ran it through sudo. find solution

Finally:
Complete all error handling


Changes in JDBC configuration:
Made 5 pyramid levels
for worldfile: "TFW=YES" to be used for tiff

command used for importing image data:
    java -Xbootclasspath/a:/usr/share/java/postgresql-jdbc.jar  -jar /home/orange/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/gt-imagemosaic-jdbc-21.1.jar import -config /home/orange/geoserver/data_dir/coverages/osm.postgis.xml -spatialTNPrefix secondtable -tileTNPrefix secondtable -dir tiles -ext tif
(changed a bit)
